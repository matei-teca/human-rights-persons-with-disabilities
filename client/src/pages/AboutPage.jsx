          <h2>What is the CRPD?</h2>
          <p>
            The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is an international treaty
            that protects the rights of persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental health disabilities.
            Its goal is to ensure full participation, equality, and dignity for everyone, regardless of their abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental health disabilities are often overlooked, but the CRPD explicitly recognizes them, emphasizing the need for accessible mental health care,
            non-discrimination, and societal acceptance.
